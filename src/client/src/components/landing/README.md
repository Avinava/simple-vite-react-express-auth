## Design Principles

### 1. **Modularity**
Each component is self-contained and can be easily reordered, removed, or modified without affecting others.

### 2. **Responsive Design**
All components use Material-UI's responsive breakpoints and are optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop.

### 3. **Performance**
- Components use React.memo where appropriate
- Animations are GPU-accelerated
- Images and assets are optimized

### 4. **Accessibility**
- Proper semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels where needed
- Keyboard navigation support
- Color contrast compliance

### 5. **Modern Styling**
- CSS-in-JS with Material-UI's sx prop
- Consistent spacing using theme values
- Smooth transitions and micro-interactions
- Gradient backgrounds and modern visual effects

## Usage

Import components individually or use the barrel export:

```jsx
// Individual imports
import HeroSection from './components/landing/HeroSection';
import StatsSection from './components/landing/StatsSection';

// Barrel import (recommended)
import {
  HeroSection,
  StatsSection,
  FeaturesSection,
  TestimonialsSection,
  CTASection,
  FAQSection,
  NewsletterSection,
} from './components/landing';

// Usage in Landing page
const Landing = () => (
  <Box>
    <Header />
    <HeroSection />
    <StatsSection />
    <FeaturesSection />
    <TestimonialsSection />
    <CTASection />
    <FAQSection />
    <NewsletterSection />
    <Footer />
  </Box>
);
```

## Customization

### Theme Integration
All components use the Material-UI theme system. Customize colors, typography, and spacing through the theme configuration:

```jsx
// In your theme file
const theme = createTheme({
  palette: {
    primary: {
      main: '#your-primary-color',
    },
    secondary: {
      main: '#your-secondary-color',
    },
  },
});
```

### Content Modification
Each component contains its data inline for easy customization. For larger applications, consider moving data to:
- JSON files
- CMS integration
- Environment variables
- Database

### Styling Customization
Components use Material-UI's sx prop for styling. Override styles by:
1. Modifying the sx prop directly
2. Using theme overrides
3. Creating custom styled components

## Animation Details

### Entrance Animations
- **Fade**: Used for content that should appear smoothly
- **Grow**: Used for cards and interactive elements
- **Staggered**: Multiple elements animate in sequence

### Hover Effects
- **Transform**: Subtle translateY for lift effect
- **Box Shadow**: Enhanced shadows on hover
- **Color Transitions**: Smooth color changes

### Performance Considerations
- Animations use `transform` and `opacity` for GPU acceleration
- `will-change` property is used sparingly
- Animation durations are optimized for perceived performance

## Browser Support

Components are tested and supported on:
- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

## Contributing

When adding new landing components:
1. Follow the existing naming convention
2. Include proper TypeScript types (if using TypeScript)
3. Add responsive design considerations
4. Include accessibility features
5. Update the barrel export in index.js
6. Document any new props or features
